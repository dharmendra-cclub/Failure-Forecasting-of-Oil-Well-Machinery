 ## Failure Forecasting of Oil Well Machinery 
- Conducted failure forecasting for  oil wells using time series data from sensors and failure events
- Visualized data, performed missing value imputation and feature engineering to forecast failure with a horizon of 5 days
- Used Random Forest, Naive Bayes, LSTM and 1D-CNN with walk forward cross validation. Random Forest performed better 
with a recall score of 0.66 and was evaluated along with precision, F1 score and Confusion Matrix
